This demo a prototype of applying a Discrete Fourier Transform to a sum of sineusodial waves.

There are four waves the user can modify individually, altering their:
- Amplitude
- Frequencies
- Phase
- Propagation Direction

I want to ensure I have the Discrete Fourier Transform algorithm implemented as accurately as possible before expanding the prototype to enable:
- Non- sinusoidal waves
- Aperiodic waves
